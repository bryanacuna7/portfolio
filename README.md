## HR Dashboard

### User Story
As an HR manager, I want a comprehensive dashboard to analyze human resources data, providing both summary views for high-level insights and detailed employee records for in-depth analysis.

---

### Summary View

The summary view should be divided into three main sections: **Overview**, **Demographics**, and **Income Analysis**.

### Overview
The Overview section should provide a snapshot of the overall HR metrics, including:
- Display the total number of hired employees, active employees, and terminated employees.  
- Visualize the total number of hired and terminated employees over the years.  
- Present a breakdown of total employees by department and job titles.  
- Compare total employees between headquarters (HQ) and branches (New York is the HQ).  
- Show the distribution of employees by city and state.  

### Demographics
The Demographics section should offer insights into the composition of the workforce, including:
- Present the gender ratio in the company.  
- Visualize the distribution of employees across age groups and education levels.  
- Show the total number of employees within each age group.  
- Show the total number of employees within each education level.  
- Present the correlation between employees‚Äô educational backgrounds and their performance ratings.  

### Income Analysis
The Income Analysis section should focus on salary-related metrics, including:
- Compare salaries across different education levels for both genders to identify any discrepancies or patterns.  
- Present how age correlates with salary for employees in each department.  

---

## Employee Records View

Provide a comprehensive list of all employees with necessary information such as name, department, position, gender, age, education, and salary.  
- Users should be able to filter the list based on any of the available columns.
